# Votations
Thunderstorm PvP uses a new map voting system called "votations". A votation is similar to the traditional rotation system, just ignores the order of maps listed and instead allows users decide by voting for the next map. Rotations now act more as a "map selection" of potential maps that can be played.

In this repo you will find the listing of maps in our default votation which is in use 90% of the time. Though on occasion we may use one of our speciality votations, please ask a staff member if you are interested in viewing these maps.
